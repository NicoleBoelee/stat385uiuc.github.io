### STAT 385: Statistical Programming Methods

The world is rapidly evolving to rely on data driven decisions. These decisions come from the work a statistician or data scientist presents in his or her reports. In order to present an analysis, the analyst needs to be able to leverage computing resources through programming to unearth patterns and models that exist within data sets. As a result, statisticians and data scientists must be savvy to programming methods that are useful to the wide variety of analysis that they will be expected to perform.
